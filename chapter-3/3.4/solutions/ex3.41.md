# Exercise 3.41

Ben Bitdiddle worries that it would be better to implement the bank account as
follows (where the commented line has been changed):

```scheme
(define (make-account balance)
  (define (withdraw amount)
    (if (>= balance amount)
        (begin (set! balance (- balance amount))
               balance)
        "Insufficient funds"))

  (define (deposit amount)
    (set! balance (+ balance amount))
    balance)

  (let ((protected (make-serializer)))
    (define (dispatch m)
      (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) (protected withdraw))
            ((eq? m 'deposit) (protected deposit))
            ((eq? m 'balance)
             ((protected (lambda () balance)))) ; serialized
            (else (error "Unknown request -- MAKE-ACCOUNT"
                         m))))
    dispatch))
```

because allowing unserialized access to the bank balance can result in anomalous
behavior. Do you agree? Is there any scenario that demonstrates Ben's concern?

It depends, the book states that
